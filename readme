This project has been a great opportunity for me to reinforce my knowledge in CSS, HTML, and JS.
It's been my first time working extensively with the DOM, mastering basic JS concepts, and implementing many interesting features. 
Transforming the grid was indeed a challenging task for me at this stage, but also quite fascinating.
In this project, I avoided using grid and relied solely on flexbox to deepen my understanding of this technology, which made the task a bit more complex.

Functionality:

Dynamic grid resizing
"Drawing" functionality on hover over the grid
Erasing functionality
Toggling grid borders
Changing colors for background and drawing
